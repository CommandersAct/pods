<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>As we expended TagCommander's mobile possibilities, it rapidly became apparent that we could not fit everything at the same time for everybody in only one big SDK. In fact it's contradictory with Tag Management itself, so we decided to cut functionnalities into smaller modules so people wouldn't need to add everything in their project, saving space in your application.</p>
<p>But even with that said, a part of our code is pretty usefull in several of our modules, so we created a Core module to prevent code repetition and thus also bigger applications if you need several modules.</p>
<h1 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h1>
<p>The Core module is mandatory if you are using TagCommander's mobile solution so we simply put the dependencies needed for the Core module directly in the documentations of the other modules.</p>
<p>On iOS Core isn't compiling with any dependencies.</p>
